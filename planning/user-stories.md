## Resource Wall User Stories

  -  As a user, I want to be able to save resources(title, description and external url), because I want to review them later.
  -  As a user, I want to be able to search for already-saved resources created by any user.
  -  As a user, I want to be able to categorize any resource under a topic.
  -  As a user, I want to be able to comment on any resource.
  -  As a user, I want to be able to rate any resource.
  -  As a user, I want to be able to like any resource.
  -  As a user, I want to be able to view all my own resources and all my liked resources on one page ("My resources").
  -  As a user, I want to be able to update my profile.

### Optional
- As a user, I want to be able to edit resources I have added (title, description and external url), because I want to keep my shared resources up to date.
- As a user, I shouldn't be able to edit other users resources (title, description and external url), because I don't own those resources.
