# Resource Wall
Resource Wall is a resource sharing site that allows users to save and share learning resources (like tutorials, blogs and videos) in a central place, publicly available to any user.  
It has been built using CSS, JavaScript, and EJS for the frontend, and NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL for the backend.

## Purpose
This project was created, designed, and built by: 
* [devvaru](https://github.com/Devvaru)
* [shivangi0109](https://github.com/shivangi0109)
* [kazvee](https://github.com/kazvee)  

for our Midterm Project at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-flex-program).

### Project Goals 
* Build a web app from start to finish using the tech and approaches learned to date
* Turn requirements into a working product
* Practice architecting an app in terms of UI/UX, Routes/API and Database
* Manage a multi-developer project with git version control
* Simulate the working world where we do not always get to select our colleagues, tech stack, or product features
* Collaborate, communicate, and project manage
* Simulate on the job structures and supports
* Practice demoing an app in a presentation to help prepare for the final project and employer interviews

### Project Outcomes & Learning Achievements
While working to build this project to successful completion, we: 
* Used git best practices (sans rebase) when working on a project with multiple members (branching and merging often), as well as the GitHub workflow (pull requests).
* Used the major steps of software development to execute the project; user stories, wireframes, ERD, Routes, etc.
* Collaborated effectively as a team to decide how to break out the work, setting up a good team structure and a pleasant and positive work dynamic.
* Engaged in a simulated on the job environment.
* Prepared and planned how to tailor our communication and presentation approach for a technical as well as and non-technical audience.
* Presented a web development project to a technical and non-technical audience.
* Had a lot of fun! üòÉ

## Installation

### Getting Started
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork onto your local device.
3. Install all dependencies using the `npm install` (or `npm i`) command.

### Set up Database
4. In a terminal window, connect to your PostgreSQL environment using `psql` and your login credentials.
   * In some environments, the `startpostgres` command may need to be run first.
5. Create a new database using the `CREATE DATABASE resourcewall;` command, where 'resourcewall' is the name you want to call this new db.
6. Connect to the new database with the `\c resourcewall` command, where 'resourcewall' is whichever name you chose for your new db in the the previous step.

### Add Database Credentials to dotenv file (`.env`) 
7. Using the provided `.env.example` file as a template, create a new file named `.env` in the same folder.
8. Add your database name, username, and password.
    * Note: If running the app locally, the `DB_HOST` would be `localhost`, and for PostgreSQL the `PORT` will usually be `5432`.
    * For security reasons, the `.env` file has been added to the `.gitignore` file, so these sensitive details will not accidentally be published to GitHub.

### Fix Node-Sass Binary Binding Issue
9. Build the binding for your current node environment by running `npm rebuild node-sass` to recompile the package

### Set up Tables & Data
10. From the root folder, run the `npm run db:reset` command. It runs through each database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) file, in order, and executes them against the database.
    * This command should be run each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
    * **Note:** you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to DROP the tables and recreate them.

### Start the App
11. Ensure you are running `psql`.
12. From the project root folder, start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
13. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
14. Start adding or browsing resources! üôÇ
